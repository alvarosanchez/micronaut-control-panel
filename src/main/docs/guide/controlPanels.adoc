All Control Panels are configurable with the following properties:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.controlpanel.core.config.ControlPanelConfiguration.adoc[]

For example, to disable the routes control panel, set the property
`micronaut.control-panel.panels.routes.enabled` to `false`.

Beyond displaying the available panels, the control panel also allows to perform 2 additional actions, provided that the
corresponding endpoints are enabled and non-sensitive:

* *Refresh*: refreshing the application will cause all `@Refreshable` beans in the context to be destroyed and
  re-instantiated upon further requests. This requires the
  https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#refreshEndpoint[Refresh Endpoint] to be enabled and non-sensitive.

* *Stop*: will shut down the application. This requires the
  https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#stopEndpoint[Stop Endpoint] to be enabled and non-sensitive.

WARNING: Micronaut Endpoints require having the `io.micronaut:micronaut-management` dependency on the classpath.
