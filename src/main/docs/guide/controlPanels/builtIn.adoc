The following control panels are available by default with the UI module:

* `routes`: displays information about the available HTTP routes.

=== HTTP Routes

This panel relies on the
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#routesEndpoint[Routes Endpoint] to display the information. This endpoint
is sensitive by default, so if you want to see the HTTP routes in the control panel, you need to configure the
endpoint to be accessible to anonymous users in the environments where the control panel is enabled:

IMPORTANT: Make sure this is done in an environment-specific configuration file, for example, `application-dev.yml`.
